    <h3>Front-end developer student from New York, USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</h3>
    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        My name is Melissa CavÃ©, and I am a front-end developer student based in
        the United States. I am a college graduate with two exceptional degrees
        - with a bachelors in Psychology, as well as a masters in Elementary and
        Special Education.
        <br />
        <br />
        My current position involves me teaching sixth-grade adolescents
        Mathematics (specifically beginners algebra). I have been in the field
        of education for over five years, and I have been able to experience
        several sides of this industry.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        I have also worn many hats throughout my experience as an educator in
        and out of the classroom. During this experience, I have also been able
        to partake in the role as a STEM Coach for the Girls Who Code program at
        my current place of work.
        <br />
        <br />
        Based on my amazing experience with this program, I found my niche in
        wanting to learn more about coding and essentially applying those skills
        within a new field - the tech world.
